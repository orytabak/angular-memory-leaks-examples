    <div class="card-text">
      This component uses a "bind" method to add a custom handler via a root-scope service.<br>
      This preserves the entire scope of the component for the events closure.<br>
      Since the callback still has a reference inside the service even after the component is destroyed, the instance will remain in memory since it is accessible from the service.<br>
      We need to make sure we nullify any reference to a component's scope when it is destroyed.
